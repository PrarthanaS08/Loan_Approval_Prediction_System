#Loan Approval Prediction System (Machine Learning + Streamlit)

A Machine Learning based web application that predicts whether a loan will be Approved ✅ or Rejected ❌ based on customer details such as income, credit history, education, marital status, employment type, loan amount, and property area.

The project is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app that also generates a mini loan statement with date/time and allows users to download it.
